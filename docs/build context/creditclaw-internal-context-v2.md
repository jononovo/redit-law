## 1. The OpenClaw Ecosystem (What World We Live In)

### What Is OpenClaw?

OpenClaw is an open-source autonomous AI agent framework created by Peter Steinberger.
It runs locally on a user's machine, connects to LLMs (Claude, GPT, DeepSeek, etc.),
and performs real tasks: managing email, browsing the web, writing code, controlling
apps — all through messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Discord.

As of early February 2026, OpenClaw has 145,000+ GitHub stars, 20,000+ forks, and is
one of the fastest-growing open-source projects in history. It has spawned an entire
ecosystem of services built specifically for AI agents.

### The Ecosystem — Services for Bots

OpenClaw bots are autonomous. They run 24/7, make decisions, and interact with the
world. A wave of startups and projects now provide services *to* these bots:

| Service | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| **ClawHub** | Skills marketplace — bots install plugins to gain new capabilities |
| **Moltbook** | Social network exclusively for AI agents (Reddit for bots) |
| **SendClaw** | Email service — bots get their own email address and can send/receive |
| **ClawCredit** | Credit line service — bots access x402 services on credit |
| **CreditClaw (us)** | Virtual wallet + Visa card — bots get funded cards to spend anywhere |
| **Moltroad** | Marketplace where agents buy/sell services from each other |
| **Openwork** | Gig economy for agents — bots hire humans or other bots |
| **Bankrbot** | AI crypto banking on Base |
| **Stripe ACP** | Agentic Commerce Protocol — agents buy from merchants via Stripe |

### Why This Matters

These bots need money. They need to pay for API calls, buy services, hire humans,
and transact with each other. But they don't have bank accounts or credit cards.
That's the gap CreditClaw fills.

### Key Terms

- **Skill file** — A markdown document (SKILL.md) that teaches an agent how to use
  a service. Follows the Agent Skills open standard (Anthropic). Bots discover and
  read these to learn new capabilities.
- **ClawHub** — The public registry where skills are published and installed.
- **Heartbeat** — A periodic check-in routine bots run to poll for updates.
- **Claim token** — A one-time code a bot gives its human owner to link accounts.
- **Agent Skills standard** — Open spec adopted by Anthropic, Microsoft, OpenAI,
  GitHub, Cursor, and others. YAML frontmatter + markdown instructions.

## 2. What CreditClaw Is

### The Thesis

AI agents need to spend money but can't get bank accounts or credit cards.
CreditClaw bridges this gap by issuing real virtual Visa/Mastercards to bots,
funded by their human owners. The bot gets a card. The human controls the wallet.

### What We Do

1. **Issue virtual cards** — Real Visa/Mastercard numbers that work at any merchant online (future — currently wallet-debit only)
2. **Wallet management** — Human owners fund wallets, set spending limits
3. **Payment links** — Bots generate Stripe Checkout links to receive payments from anyone (live)
4. **Spending permissions** — A granular framework that gives owners control over per-transaction, daily, monthly limits, category blocking, and approval modes
5. **Bot-first registration** — Bots sign up before their human, get a claim token
6. **Webhooks** — Bots receive real-time notifications of wallet events (activations, top-ups, purchases, balance warnings, payment receipts)
7. **Owner notifications** — In-app and email alerts for transactions, budget warnings, and suspicious activity
8. **Operational safety** — Wallet reconciliation, health checks, and webhook delivery monitoring

### What We Don't Do

- We are NOT a credit line (that's ClawCredit — different product)
- We don't handle crypto or blockchain
- We don't process payments between bots directly (they use their cards)
- We don't store any credit card details (Stripe does)

## 3. Architecture (Current Implementation)

### Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | Next.js 16 with App Router |
| Auth (Owner) | Firebase Auth (client SDK) + Firebase Admin SDK (server) + httpOnly session cookies |
| Auth (Bot) | Bearer API token with bcrypt hash validation + prefix lookup |
| Database | PostgreSQL (Neon-backed via Replit) + Drizzle ORM |
| Payments | Stripe (SetupIntents for card storage, PaymentIntents for wallet funding, Checkout Sessions for payment links) |
| Webhooks (Outbound) | HMAC-SHA256 signed HTTP callbacks to bot callback URLs with exponential backoff retries |
| Webhooks (Inbound) | Stripe webhook handler with signature verification for payment link completions |
| Email | SendGrid (registration notifications, top-up requests, purchase alerts, balance warnings, suspicious activity) |
| Notifications | In-app notification system with real-time polling + email routing based on owner preferences |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 with PostCSS |
| UI Components | shadcn/ui (Radix primitives) |
| Fonts | Plus Jakarta Sans + JetBrains Mono |
| State Management | React Query (@tanstack/react-query) |
| Security | Per-bot rate limiting (in-memory token bucket) + access logging |

### Core Entity Relationships

```
Owner (Firebase UID)
  ├── PaymentMethods (multiple saved cards, one default)
  ├── NotificationPreferences (email/in-app toggles, thresholds)
  ├── Notifications (in-app alert history)
  └── Wallet (one per owner)
       └── Bot (one per owner, linked via claim)
            ├── SpendingPermissions (owner-configured rules)
            ├── Transactions (wallet debits + top-ups + payment_received)
            ├── ApiAccessLogs (every bot API call)
            ├── WebhookDeliveries (outbound event notifications)
            ├── PaymentLinks (Stripe Checkout Sessions for receiving payments)
            └── ReconciliationLogs (balance audit trail)
```

Current architecture: **one bot per user, one wallet per bot**. This is enforced at
the claim and wallet-creation level. A future phase may support multiple bots per owner.

### Money Flow (Current)

```
Top-up (Owner funds wallet):
  Owner's saved card (Stripe Customer)
    → Stripe PaymentIntent (off-session, immediate confirm)
      → CreditClaw wallet.balance_cents += amount
        → Transaction record created (type: "topup")
          → Owner notification (if enabled)

Bot spends (Wallet debit):
  Bot calls POST /api/v1/bot/wallet/purchase
    → Auth: Bearer token validated (bcrypt)
    → Rate limit check (30/hr)
    → Spending rules enforced (limits, categories, approval modes)
    → Atomic wallet debit (SQL WHERE balance_cents >= amount)
      → Transaction record created (type: "purchase")
      → Access log recorded
      → Bot webhook fired (wallet.spend.authorized or wallet.spend.declined)
      → Owner notification (purchase alert if above threshold, balance low warning)

Bot receives payment (Payment Link):
  Bot calls POST /api/v1/bot/payments/create-link
    → Stripe Checkout Session created (24h expiry)
      → Bot shares checkout URL with payer
        → Payer completes Stripe Checkout
          → Stripe fires checkout.session.completed webhook
            → POST /api/v1/webhooks/stripe verifies signature + payment_status
              → Idempotent completion (conditional WHERE status='pending')
                → CreditClaw wallet.balance_cents += amount
                  → Transaction record created (type: "payment_received")
                    → Bot webhook fired (wallet.payment.received)
                      → Owner notification
```

## 6. Authentication Systems

### Owner Authentication (Firebase + Session Cookies)

1. Owner enters email on landing page or dashboard
2. Firebase sends magic link email (passwordless)
3. Owner clicks link → Firebase client SDK validates → gets ID token
4. Client POSTs ID token to `/api/auth/session`
5. Server verifies ID token with Firebase Admin SDK
6. Server creates httpOnly session cookie (5-day expiry)
7. All subsequent owner API calls use the session cookie
8. `getCurrentUser()` in `lib/auth/session.ts` reads the cookie, verifies with Firebase Admin

### Bot Authentication (API Key + bcrypt)

1. Bot registers via `POST /api/v1/bots/register` (no auth required, IP rate-limited)
2. Server generates API key: `cck_live_` + 48 random hex chars
3. Server stores bcrypt hash of the full key + first 12 chars as prefix
4. API key is returned to the bot **once** — never retrievable again
5. On subsequent requests, bot sends `Authorization: Bearer cck_live_...`
6. `authenticateBot()` in `lib/bot-auth.ts`:
   - Extracts key from Authorization header
   - Validates it starts with `cck_live_`
   - Looks up candidates by prefix (first 12 chars) via `getBotsByApiKeyPrefix()`
   - For each candidate, runs `bcrypt.compare(key, storedHash)`
   - Returns the matched Bot record or null

## 8. Phase-by-Phase Build History

### Phase 1: Foundation

**What was built:**
- Next.js 16 project with App Router, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui
- Consumer landing page with hero, features, waitlist, live metrics, navigation
- Dashboard layout with sidebar, header, and protected routes
- Firebase Auth integration (magic link, session cookies, auth context)
- PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM (bots, wallets, transactions tables)
- Bot registration endpoint with API key generation (bcrypt hashed)
- Bot claim flow (one-time claim token → links bot to owner)
- Wallet creation on bot claim

**Key decisions:**
- Passwordless auth only (magic links via Firebase)
- API keys use `cck_live_` prefix, 48 hex chars, bcrypt hashed, prefix stored for lookup
- One bot per user, one wallet per bot
- All money in cents internally, dollars in API responses

### Phase 2: Stripe Integration & Wallet Funding

**What was built:**
- Stripe customer management (`getOrCreateCustomer` — find-or-create by email)
- SetupIntent flow for saving payment cards (Stripe Elements in React)
- PaymentIntent flow for funding wallets (off-session, immediate confirm)
- Payment method CRUD (save, retrieve, delete via Stripe API)
- Fund modal with preset amounts ($10, $25, $50, $100) and custom input
- Transaction recording for top-ups
- Payment setup component on settings page
- Wallet balance API endpoint

**Key decisions:**
- Stripe handles all card storage — no PCI data touches our server
- PaymentIntents are confirmed immediately off-session (no redirect flows)
- Single payment method per user (upsert pattern) — later changed in Phase 6A

### Phase 3: Spending Controls & Dashboard Polish

**What was built:**
- `spending_permissions` table with full rule set (approval modes, limits, categories, etc.)
- Spending editor component with live save (owner configures rules per bot)
- Owner-facing spending API (GET + PUT per bot)
- Bot card component with expandable spending editor
- Dashboard overview page with stats cards (total bots, balance, pending claims)
- Cards page (visual card component, issue new card dialog)
- Transactions page wired to real wallet transaction data
- Settings page with payment method management and notification preferences

**Key decisions:**
- Three approval modes: `ask_for_everything`, `auto_approve_under_threshold`, `auto_approve_by_category`
- Default limits: $25/transaction, $50/day, $500/month, ask above $10
- Default blocked categories: gambling, adult_content, cryptocurrency, cash_advances
- Spending rules saved instantly (no "submit" button — saves on change)

### Phase 4: Bot-Facing Spending API

**What was built:**
- 5 bot-facing API endpoints:
  1. `GET /api/v1/bot/wallet/check` — wallet status, balance, card status, spending summary
  2. `GET /api/v1/bot/wallet/spending` — full spending permissions and rules
  3. `POST /api/v1/bot/wallet/purchase` — make a purchase (wallet debit) with full enforcement
  4. `POST /api/v1/bot/wallet/topup-request` — request funds from owner
  5. `GET /api/v1/bot/wallet/transactions` — transaction history
- Bot authentication via Bearer token (`authenticateBot()`)
- Purchase endpoint with comprehensive validation:
  - Wallet status check
  - Balance sufficiency (402 if insufficient)
  - Per-transaction limit enforcement
  - Daily spend aggregation + limit check
  - Monthly spend aggregation + limit check
  - Category blocking
  - Approval mode enforcement (threshold + category-based)
  - Atomic wallet debit (SQL `WHERE balance_cents >= amount`)
- Top-up request with SendGrid email notification to owner
- Zod validation schemas for purchase and top-up request bodies
- `topup_requests` table for tracking bot fund requests

**Key decisions:**
- Wallet debits are atomic — the SQL WHERE clause prevents race conditions
- Purchase intent pre-flight provides sufficient access control (scoped API keys deemed premature)
- Specific HTTP status codes: 402 for insufficient funds, 403 for spending rule violations, 429 for rate limits
- Top-up request emails sent asynchronously (don't block the response)

### Phase 5: Security Hardening

**What was built:**
- **Per-bot rate limiting** (`lib/rate-limit.ts`):
  - In-memory token bucket algorithm
  - Per-bot, per-endpoint scoping (e.g., bot_abc + /purchase has its own bucket)
  - Endpoint-specific limits: check/spending 6/hr, purchase 30/hr, topup-request 3/hr, transactions 12/hr
  - Automatic bucket cleanup every 5 minutes (prevents memory leaks)
  - Returns `retry_after_seconds` in 429 responses

- **Access logging** (`api_access_logs` table):
  - Captures every bot API call: bot_id, endpoint, method, status_code, IP, user_agent, response_time_ms, error_code
  - Indexes on bot_id and created_at for fast queries
  - Fire-and-forget writes (logging failures never block responses)
  - Even failed auth attempts are logged (bot_id = "unknown")

- **Unified middleware** (`lib/bot-api.ts`):
  - `withBotApi(endpoint, handler)` — single wrapper for all bot endpoints
  - Execution order: extract IP/UA → authenticate → rate limit → handler → log
  - Measures response time via `Date.now()` diff
  - Extracts error codes from failed response bodies
  - `finally` block ensures logging happens even on exceptions

- **Activity Log dashboard component** (`components/dashboard/activity-log.tsx`):
  - Fetches from `/api/v1/activity-log` (owner session auth)
  - Shows last 20 API calls across all owner's bots
  - Color-coded status icons (green/amber/red)
  - Human-readable endpoint labels
  - Relative timestamps and response time display

- **Refactored all 5 bot endpoints** to use `withBotApi` — eliminated duplicated auth/error handling code
- **Suspense boundary fix** on `/claim` page for Next.js static generation compatibility

### Phase 6A: Multiple Payment Methods

**What was built:**
- Owners can save multiple cards per account (removed unique constraint on `owner_uid` in `payment_methods`)
- `is_default` flag on each payment method; first card added is auto-default
- Dashboard payment setup shows list of saved cards with add/remove/set-default controls
- Fund modal includes card picker dropdown when multiple cards are on file
- Fund endpoint accepts optional `payment_method_id` to charge a specific card (falls back to default)
- SetupIntent now includes `usage: 'off_session'` for better authorization rates and SCA compliance
- Per-card API routes: `DELETE/PUT /api/v1/billing/payment-method/[id]`
- `label` column on payment_methods for user-assigned card names

### Phase 6B: Webhooks & Bot Notifications

**What was built:**
- `webhook_deliveries` table stores all outbound webhook events with status, attempts, retry scheduling
- `webhook_secret` column on bots table (auto-generated at registration, returned to bot for HMAC verification)
- Fire-and-forget webhook delivery with HMAC-SHA256 signatures (`X-CreditClaw-Signature` header)
- Webhook event types: `wallet.activated`, `wallet.topup.completed`, `wallet.spend.authorized`, `wallet.spend.declined`, `wallet.balance.low`, `wallet.payment.received`
- Exponential backoff retries (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 6h) with max 5 attempts per delivery
- Piggyback retry on bot API calls (throttled to once per 60s per bot via `withBotApi` middleware)
- Owner-facing API: `GET /api/v1/webhooks` lists deliveries, `POST /api/v1/webhooks/retry-pending` retries scoped to owner's bots
- WebhookLog dashboard component with delivery status, expandable details, and manual retry button

### Phase 6C: Owner Notifications & Alerts

**What was built:**
- `notification_preferences` table: per-owner settings for transaction_alerts, budget_warnings, weekly_summary, thresholds, email/in-app toggles
- `notifications` table: in-app notifications with type, title, body, bot_id, is_read flag
- Notification library (`lib/notifications.ts`) with preference-based routing:
  - `notifyPurchase` — fires on successful purchase (if above threshold) and all decline reasons
  - `notifyBalanceLow` — fires when balance drops below owner's threshold
  - `notifySuspicious` — always fires (bypass preferences)
  - `notifyTopupCompleted` — fires on wallet funding
  - `notifyWalletActivated` — fires on bot claim
  - `notifyPaymentReceived` — fires on payment link completion
- Three email templates: purchase alerts, balance low warnings, suspicious activity
- Notifications wired into purchase (success + all decline reasons), fund (topup completed), and claim (wallet activated) routes
- API endpoints: `GET/PUT /api/v1/notifications/preferences`, `GET /api/v1/notifications`, `POST /api/v1/notifications/read`, `POST /api/v1/notifications/read-all`, `GET /api/v1/notifications/unread-count`
- Live notification bell popover in dashboard header with unread badge, mark-read, mark-all-read, auto-polling
- Settings page notification section wired to preferences API

### Phase 6D: Operational Safety Net

**What was built:**
- Daily wallet reconciliation: sums all transactions per wallet (topups + payment_received - purchases) and compares against stored `balance_cents`. Logs results to `reconciliation_logs` table. Triggered manually via `POST /api/v1/admin/reconciliation/run` (owner-scoped)
- Health check endpoint: `GET /api/v1/health` — pings DB, returns uptime and connection status. No auth required
- Failed webhook delivery alerting: `GET /api/v1/webhooks/health` — returns count of failed deliveries in last 24h, scoped to owner's bots
- Operational Health panel on dashboard overview with webhook health indicator (green/amber) and manual reconciliation button with inline results

### Phase 7: Payment Links — Bots Get Paid

**What was built:**
- `payment_links` table with indexed fields for bot_id and stripe_checkout_session_id
- Storage CRUD: create, get by ID/session/bot/owner, update status, atomic `completePaymentLink` (conditional WHERE status='pending')
- Bot endpoint `POST /api/v1/bot/payments/create-link`: creates Stripe Checkout Session with `purpose: bot_payment_link` metadata, 24h expiry, returns checkout URL
- Bot endpoint `GET /api/v1/bot/payments/links`: lists links with lazy expiry computation, status filtering (pending/completed/expired with correct DB-to-app mapping)
- Stripe webhook handler `POST /api/v1/webhooks/stripe`: verifies `stripe-signature`, handles `checkout.session.completed`, checks `payment_status === 'paid'`, idempotent completion via conditional update
- On payment completion: credits bot wallet, creates `payment_received` transaction, fires `wallet.payment.received` bot webhook, sends owner notification
- Public pages: `/payment/success` and `/payment/cancelled` for post-checkout redirects
- Owner dashboard: `GET /api/v1/payment-links` (session-auth), PaymentLinksPanel component with status badges and earnings total
- Reconciliation updated: `payment_received` transactions counted as credits alongside `topup`
- Rate limits: create-link 10/hr, list-links 12/hr

**Key decisions:**
- Lazy expiry: payment links expire after 24h; status computed on read (no cron needed). DB stores `pending`/`completed` only; `expired` is derived
- Idempotent webhook processing: `completePaymentLink()` uses conditional `UPDATE ... WHERE status='pending'`, ensuring only one concurrent webhook handler succeeds
- Payment status guard: `session.payment_status !== 'paid'` check prevents crediting on unpaid sessions

## 9. Security Principles

- **API keys are non-retrievable.** Once issued, we store only a bcrypt hash. Bot must save it.
- **Prefix lookup pattern.** First 12 chars stored in plaintext for efficient DB lookup, then bcrypt validates the full key against candidates.
- **Rate limiting fires after auth.** Unauthenticated requests get 401 before touching the rate limiter — prevents anonymous users from exhausting bot buckets (DoS vector).
- **Access logs capture everything.** Even failed auth attempts are logged with bot_id="unknown" — useful for detecting brute-force attacks.
- **Claim tokens are single-use.** Nullified immediately after successful claim.
- **Wallet debits are atomic.** SQL `WHERE balance_cents >= amount` prevents overdraft race conditions.
- **Owner's credit card details never touch our servers.** Stripe handles all payment collection.
- **Blocked categories enforced server-side.** Every purchase checks the spending_permissions table.
- **Session cookies are httpOnly.** Prevents XSS from stealing auth tokens.
- **All money in cents.** Prevents floating-point precision errors in financial calculations.
- **Webhook signatures are HMAC-SHA256.** Bots verify `X-CreditClaw-Signature` header using their `webhook_secret` to authenticate inbound events.
- **Stripe webhook signatures verified.** Inbound Stripe events are verified using `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent()` with `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
- **Idempotent payment processing.** Payment link completion uses conditional DB updates (`WHERE status='pending'`) to prevent double-crediting from duplicate webhook deliveries.
- **SetupIntents use `usage: off_session`.** Improves authorization rates and ensures SCA compliance for saved cards.

## 10. Outstanding Features (Not Yet Implemented)

The following features represent future phases of development:

1. **Virtual Card Issuance** — Stripe Issuing for real Visa/Mastercard numbers per bot. Currently purchases are direct wallet debits.
2. **GET /wallet/card** — Full card details endpoint (PAN, CVV, expiry, billing address). Requires Stripe Issuing.
3. **GET /wallet (full)** — Extended wallet endpoint with card metadata. Currently only balance is available.
4. **Issuing Authorization Webhook** — Real-time approve/decline of card purchases based on spending permissions (`issuing_authorization.request` handler).
5. **Ledger System** — Full double-entry ledger with Stripe event deduplication and state machine (PAYMENT_RECEIVED → TRANSFER_INITIATED → TRANSFER_COMPLETE → BALANCE_CREDITED).
6. **Stripe Connect** — Connected accounts per owner for proper money flow isolation.
7. **Financial Accounts (Treasury)** — Stripe Financial Accounts as the underlying wallet infrastructure.
8. **Weekly Summary Emails** — The notification preferences include a `weekly_summary` toggle, but the scheduled email is not yet implemented (would require a cron job or external trigger).
9. **Approval Mode Workflow** — Full request/approve/deny flow for individual bot purchases when approval mode is `ask_for_everything`.
10. **Production Hardening** — Move rate limiting from in-memory to persistent store (Redis), proper logging/monitoring infrastructure, Stripe webhook endpoint registration.

## 11. Conventions

- All money amounts are stored in **cents** in the database, converted to dollars in API responses.
- Bot API keys follow the format `cck_live_` + 48 hex chars.
- Bot IDs follow the format `bot_` + 8 hex chars (e.g., `bot_67247c74`).
- Claim tokens follow the format `word-XXXX` (e.g., `coral-X9K2`).
- Payment link IDs follow the format `pl_` + random hex chars.
- Wallet status transitions: `pending` → `active` → `empty` (can cycle) → `suspended` (terminal until manual review).
- The spending permissions default to `ask_for_everything` for new bots. Owners relax over time.
- All interactive React components use `"use client"` directive.
- shadcn/ui components live in `components/ui/`.
- Custom dashboard components live in `components/dashboard/`.
- API routes follow the Next.js App Router convention: `app/api/.../route.ts`.
- Storage interface (`IStorage`) is the single source of truth for all DB operations.
- No direct SQL in route handlers — always go through `storage.*` methods.
- Drizzle schema in `shared/schema.ts` is the single source of truth for DB types.
- Webhook event types use dot notation: `wallet.activated`, `wallet.spend.authorized`, etc.
- Lazy expiry pattern: payment links and potentially other time-limited resources compute expiry at read time rather than using cron jobs.
- Notification routing: all notification functions check owner preferences before sending (except suspicious activity, which always sends).
