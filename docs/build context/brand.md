# CreditClaw Brand Identity

CreditClaw is a fun, consumer-facing service that gives AI agents ("Claw Agents") secure spending power. The brand is playful, approachable, and designed to feel like a modern fintech product for the AI era—without the cold, corporate feel of traditional finance or the complex jargon of crypto.

## Core Identity

- **Name:** CreditClaw
- **Tagline:** Pocket money for your bots!
- **Mission:** The fun, safe way to give your OpenClaw agent an allowance.
- **Tone:** Playful, helpful, lighthearted, trustworthy, "consumer-tech" (not "enterprise-saas").

## Visual Language

The visual style is defined by "Soft Clay 3D" aesthetics, rounded geometry, and a vibrant pastel color palette. It feels tactile, friendly, and modern.

- **Mascot:** A friendly 3D clay-style lobster (often just the claw/pincer) holding a credit card.

### UI Design System ("Fun Consumer")
