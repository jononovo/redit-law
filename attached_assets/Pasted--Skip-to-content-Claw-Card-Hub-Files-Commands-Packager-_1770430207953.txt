Published your App
yes

Let's get started! First, I need your Firebase credentials.

I need 6 values from your Firebase project to set up authentication. You can find these in the Firebase Console:

Public values (from Firebase Console > Project Settings > Your App > SDK setup):

NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY — Your Firebase API key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN — Usually your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID — Your Firebase project ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID — Your Firebase app ID
Private values (from Firebase Console > Project Settings > Service Accounts > Generate New Private Key):

FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL — The service account email (looks like firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com)
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY — The private key from the downloaded JSON file (the long string starting with -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----)
Make sure you have Google sign-in enabled under Authentication > Sign-in method in your Firebase Console. If you also want GitHub sign-in, enable that too.

Secrets
Key
Value
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
Can you install it yourself?

The authentication system is set up — can you try clicking "Log in" or "Sign Up" on the landing page to test the sign-in drawer?

Here's what you can tell the other agent:

Add entries to .gitignore for any temporary/generated files like LOG, CURRENT, COMMENT, LOCK, MANIFEST-* (these are typically LevelDB/database temp files)
If a file is already being tracked by Git, just adding it to .gitignore isn't enough — you also need to run git rm --cached <filename> to untrack it without deleting it
The .next/ folder should always be ignored (it's the build cache)

Good call. Let me clean up the .gitignore to cover those temp files and make sure .next/ and the database temp files are properly ignored.

There are a lot of .next/ files tracked by git. Let me update the .gitignore and untrack everything that shouldn't be there.

920 files tracked in .next/. Let me untrack them all, plus any LevelDB temp files.

I see — git rm is restricted in this environment. That's fine. The .gitignore is now updated with the right entries, so any new commits going forward won't include those files. The tracked files will need to be cleaned up manually by someone with git access, but the .gitignore will prevent new ones from being added.

Here's what the updated .gitignore now covers:

.next/ — the entire Next.js build cache directory
LOG, CURRENT, LOCK, MANIFEST-* — LevelDB/database temp files
.env files — environment variable files (we use Replit secrets instead)
node_modules, dist, and other standard ignores
For the already-tracked .next/ files (about 920 of them), you'd need to run git rm --cached -r .next/ from a terminal with git write access to fully untrack them. But from this point forward, they won't be re-added.

OK now I need you to generate the OG "social" images for all the different sizes and platforms and the favicon so that we can link to this and share it.

Does that make sense?

Can you create a plan for this and then implement it?

No, please analyze our current landing page and the image on our current landing page and our branding style as we're using like 3-D clay, simple and informal and the colors are wrong. Everything is wrong.

please use this as our starting point.

Can you add those into an "og-pink" folder

And then generate new ones based off this image and the landing page:

Now let me generate the new set based on the black card lobster and the landing page style — white/light background, coral-orange lobster, black CreditClaw card, clean modern feel.

CreditClaw OG black card
CreditClaw Twitter black card
CreditClaw square black card
CreditClaw black card favicon
CreditClaw OG black card
CreditClaw Twitter black card
CreditClaw square black card
CreditClaw black card favicon
Now let me regenerate the favicon sizes.

Done. Here's what happened:

Pink card variants moved to public/images/og-pink/ for safekeeping
New black card set generated to match your landing page style:
og-image.png — Main OG image with coral lobster + black card on light background
og-twitter.png — Twitter/X card version
og-square.png — Square version for WhatsApp etc.
apple-touch-icon.png + favicons — Claw icon matching the black card style
The metadata in the layout already points to these file paths, so they're live immediately. You now have both sets — pink card variants saved in og-pink/ if you ever want to switch back.

Also, I think we should use our logo as sort of the Favicon instead of instead of generating a new one

I love it. It looks beautiful thank you.

Can you make sure that all the og /social images Are not in the public images folder, but actually in their own "og" folder

And that everywhere that links to them is updated and that that works.

Does that make sense?

Totally makes sense — move all the OG/social images into their own public/og/ folder and update all references. Let me do that.

Now let me update the references in the layout file.

All done. The OG/social images now live in their own public/og/ folder (with the pink variants in public/og/og-pink/), and the layout metadata has been updated to point to the new paths. The app is running with the changes.

I see a bunch of changes in the gate, but they're not saved into a commit yet. Do you want to save everything?

The changes are actually saved automatically — the system creates checkpoints as we work (you can see those in your checkpoint history). I don't have the ability to make manual git commits, but those automatic checkpoints capture every change we've made, so nothing is lost. You're all set!

I'm currently getting internal server error on the published version of this.
Can you look into the logs?
