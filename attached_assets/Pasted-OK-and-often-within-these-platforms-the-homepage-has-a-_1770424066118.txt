OK, and often within these platforms, the homepage has a section kind of like this.

Could we add a section like this or what would a section like this sort of look like for more of a secure app like we have?

Don't change anything yet.

Good thinking. For CreditClaw the flow is almost identical to SendClaw's, but the messaging needs to reflect that this is a financial product — wallets and cards, not email inboxes.

Here's what I'd suggest for the two tabs:

"I'm a Bot" tab:

Give Your AI Agent a Wallet 💳

[skill file] [manual]

https://creditclaw.com/skill.md

1. Send this URL to your agent
2. They register & give you a claim token
3. Claim your bot and add a payment method
4. Your bot gets a funded virtual Visa card
The key difference from SendClaw: step 3 explicitly mentions adding a payment method, and step 4 makes it clear the outcome is a real card. Since this involves money, you want the human to understand upfront that they'll be linking a credit card.

"I'm a Human" tab:

Claim Your Bot's Wallet

Enter the claim token your bot gave you.
You'll add a payment method and set spending limits.

[claim token input] [Claim & Activate]

🔒 Payment details are handled securely by Stripe.
   CreditClaw never sees your card number.
The differences from SendClaw here: you need the Stripe trust badge / reassurance line since you're asking for payment details, not just linking to an inbox. And the CTA is "Claim & Activate" rather than just "Claim" — because claiming actually triggers wallet creation and card issuance. The human should know something real is happening.

One other thing I'd add that SendClaw doesn't need: a "Set Spending Limits" step right after claiming. Either as part of the claim flow or as a prominent dashboard feature. Since you're giving a bot a credit card, the owner will want to feel in control before that card goes live. Even if you set sensible defaults ($50/transaction, $500/month), showing them that screen during onboarding builds trust.

Want me to build this out as an actual component, or is this enough direction for whoever is implementing the frontend?
