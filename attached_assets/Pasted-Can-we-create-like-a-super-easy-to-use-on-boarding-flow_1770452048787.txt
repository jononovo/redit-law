Can we create like a super easy to use on boarding flow that is like step-by-step slide by slide in like a full page model with very simple steps one after another asking what permissions the boat should have for what type of purchases if they should ask get authorization at each purchase or at each purchase within a certain category or just add each purchase below a certain or above a certain amount or how much they can spend per week without authorization Just go through, and then this will create at the end of the flow, the spending document which then will be sent to the bot And then it will ask the owner to instruct the bot to go to creditclub.com and register as a bot and then give a code ( 6digit code) the user will then take that code and insert it as the next step and in that way, we'll connect with the bot. ( meaning the bot will then be connected to his account and will receive the updated spending.md document. With what permission he has and what the policy is.) And then at the end of the flow, the user will be asked to add a card on how much they want to top up and allow the bot to use. Or if they just wanna add it in the event that the bot wants to request authorization for a purchase. Does that make sense? What do you think about this full page? Model simple step-by-step on boarding flow?

This is a great idea. Right now the onboarding is fragmented — the bot registers first, gives a claim token, the owner has to figure out spending permissions separately, add a card separately. It works, but it's not guided. A full-page wizard that walks the owner through everything in one sitting is a much better experience.

A few thoughts on the flow you described:

The order is smart. Permissions first, then connect the bot, then fund it. That means by the time the bot is connected, everything is already configured — it gets its spending.md immediately and the wallet is funded. No limbo state where the bot is claimed but the owner hasn't set anything up yet.

The 6-digit code flip is interesting. Right now the bot registers first and gives the owner a claim token. You're reversing it — the owner starts the flow, gets a 6-digit code, tells the bot to go register with that code. This is actually better for the onboarding wizard because the owner is already in the flow. They don't have to context-switch. The bot registers, provides the code, and the wizard picks it up on the next step.

That does mean a small change to registration: the bot would call POST /bots/register with the owner's 6-digit code instead of an owner email, and the backend matches them up. Or the owner generates the code first, the bot includes it at registration, and the webhook/polling on the wizard detects the match.

The spending permissions step is the heart of it. I'd keep it to three or four choices max per screen. Something like: "Should your bot ask before every purchase?" → Yes / No → If no, "Set a threshold — purchases below this amount are auto-approved" → slider or input → "Are there categories your bot should never spend on?" → checkboxes → done. That generates the spending.md.

The funding step at the end with the "or just add a card for later" option is good. Some owners want to pre-fund, some want to approve each top-up. Giving both options in the same step avoids forcing a decision.

Want me to build it? I'm thinking a React component — full-viewport modal, step indicator at the top, one question per step, big friendly buttons, generates the spending.md at the end, and wires into the existing claim + fund APIs.

I think registration should be able to work both ways. The owner first or the bot first.

And if the owner signs up first, it should be extremely easy and straightforward to add the bot and verify.

Does that make sense? 

I want you to build a technical plan and explanation of how we can build this based on the repo as it is now in the project knowledge.

I will then give your recommendations to another AI agent who will build it.

Do you have any questions for me so far?
