Edit Plan: 6 changes
Edit 1: Add callback_url to registration curl example
Why: A bot that wants webhooks won't know to include this field. It's the only way to opt in.
Before (lines 68-72):
  -d '{
    "bot_name": "my-research-bot",
    "owner_email": "jonathan@example.com",
    "description": "Performs web research tasks for hire"
  }'
After:
  -d '{
    "bot_name": "my-research-bot",
    "owner_email": "jonathan@example.com",
    "description": "Performs web research tasks for hire",
    "callback_url": "https://my-bot.example.com/webhook"
  }'
+1 line

Edit 2: Add webhook_secret / pairing_code notes after registration response
Why: A bot needs to know webhook_secret comes back with callback_url, and that pairing_code is an option. Currently neither is mentioned anywhere.
Before (lines 85-87):

**⚠️ Save your `api_key` immediately.** It cannot be retrieved again.
After:

Optional fields: `callback_url` (HTTPS, enables webhooks), `pairing_code` (6-digit code from owner — skips claim step, wallet activates instantly). If you provided a `callback_url`, the response includes a `webhook_secret` for verifying signatures.

**⚠️ Save your `api_key` immediately.** It cannot be retrieved again.

Edit 3: Fix "fund my card" to "fund my wallet"
Why: There are no cards. This is a leftover from the old version.
Before (line 117):
> "I've registered for a CreditClaw wallet. To activate it and fund my card,
After:
> "I've registered for a CreditClaw wallet. To activate it and fund my wallet,

Edit 4: Add purchase request fields note
Why: amount_cents being in cents (not dollars) is the most likely integration error. A bot sending 5.99 instead of 599 will get a validation error.
Before (lines 237-238):

Response (approved):
After:

`amount_cents` is in **cents** (integer) — e.g. $5.99 = `599`. `merchant` is required (1-200 chars). `description` and `category` are optional.

Response (approved):
+2 lines

Edit 5: Add HMAC signature line to webhooks section
Why: Without this, a bot receiving webhooks has no idea how to verify them or what webhook_secret is for.
Before (lines 385-387):
## Webhooks (Optional)

Provide a `callback_url` during registration to receive POST events:
After:
## Webhooks (Optional)

Provide a `callback_url` during registration to receive POST events. Webhooks are signed
with HMAC-SHA256 via the `X-CreditClaw-Signature` header — verify using your `webhook_secret`.
+1 line

Edit 6: Add 400 and 409 to error table
Why: A bot sending malformed JSON or registering a duplicate name gets these. Without them in the table it has no reference for what went wrong.
Before (lines 378-383):
| `401` | Invalid or missing API key | `{"error": "unauthorized", "message": "Invalid API key"}` |
| `402` | Insufficient funds for purchase | `{"error": "insufficient_funds", "balance_usd": 2.50, "required_usd": 10.00}` |
| `403` | Wallet frozen, not active, or spending rule violation | `{"error": "wallet_frozen", "message": "This wallet is frozen by the owner."}` |
| `429` | Rate limit exceeded | `{"error": "rate_limited", "retry_after_seconds": 600}` |
After:
| `400` | Invalid request body or parameters | `{"error": "validation_error", "message": "Invalid request body"}` |
| `401` | Invalid or missing API key | `{"error": "unauthorized", "message": "Invalid API key"}` |
| `402` | Insufficient funds for purchase | `{"error": "insufficient_funds", "balance_usd": 2.50, "required_usd": 10.00}` |
| `403` | Wallet frozen, not active, or spending rule violation | `{"error": "wallet_frozen", "message": "This wallet is frozen by the owner."}` |
| `409` | Duplicate registration or race condition | `{"error": "duplicate_registration", "message": "A bot with this name already exists."}` |
| `429` | Rate limit exceeded | `{"error": "rate_limited", "retry_after_seconds": 600}` |
+2 lines

Total: +8 lines (408 → ~416). No sections removed, no restructuring, no new sections. Just filling the gaps that would cause a bot to fail at registration, webhook verification, or purchase formatting.
