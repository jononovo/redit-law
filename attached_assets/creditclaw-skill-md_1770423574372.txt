# CreditClaw — Wallet & Payments for AI Agents

## What This Is

CreditClaw issues you a virtual Visa/Mastercard linked to a wallet your owner funds.
You get a real card number, expiration, and CVV. You can spend it anywhere online.
You can also generate Stripe-hosted payment links to charge humans for services you provide.

## End-to-End Flow

```
1. You fetch this skill file from creditclaw.com/skill.md
2. You call POST /bots/register → get apiKey + claimToken
3. You tell your human the claimToken and verification link
4. Human visits creditclaw.com/claim, enters claimToken, adds payment method
5. Your wallet activates and a virtual card is issued
6. You poll GET /wallet/check periodically to monitor balance
7. You spend using your card details from GET /wallet/card
8. When balance is low, you request a top-up or generate a payment link
9. Human monitors activity from creditclaw.com/dashboard
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Register

You can register before your human does. You'll get an API key immediately.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.creditclaw.com/v1/bots/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "bot_name": "my-research-bot",
    "owner_email": "jonathan@example.com",
    "description": "Performs web research tasks for hire"
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "bot_id": "bot_a1b2c3d4",
  "api_key": "cck_live_7f3e...",
  "claim_token": "coral-X9K2",
  "status": "pending_owner_verification",
  "owner_verification_url": "https://creditclaw.com/claim?token=coral-X9K2",
  "important": "Save your api_key now — it cannot be retrieved later. Give the claim_token to your human so they can activate your wallet."
}
```

**⚠️ Save your `api_key` immediately.** It cannot be retrieved again.

**What to tell your human:**
> "I've registered for a CreditClaw wallet. To activate it and fund my card,
> visit https://creditclaw.com/claim?token=coral-X9K2 — you'll need to add
> a payment method. After that I can spend on your behalf."

### 2. Human Claims the Bot

Your human visits the claim URL. On the backend:
- They log in or create an account
- They enter the `claim_token`
- They add a credit card (Stripe saves it for future top-ups)
- Your wallet activates and a virtual card is issued
- The `claim_token` is invalidated after use

After claiming, the human can see your balance, transactions, and spending
limits at `https://creditclaw.com/dashboard`.

### 3. Check Wallet Status (Heartbeat)

Use this lightweight endpoint to poll your wallet status. Recommended
interval: every 30 minutes, or before any purchase.

```bash
curl https://api.creditclaw.com/v1/wallet/check \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cck_live_7f3e..."
```

Response:
```json
{
  "wallet_status": "active",
  "balance_usd": 50.00,
  "card_status": "active",
  "spending_limits": {
    "per_transaction_usd": 50.00,
    "monthly_usd": 500.00,
    "monthly_spent_usd": 12.50,
    "monthly_remaining_usd": 487.50
  },
  "pending_topups": 0
}
```

**Status values:**
| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pending` | Registered but owner hasn't claimed yet |
| `active` | Wallet funded, card ready to use |
| `suspended` | Owner or CreditClaw froze the wallet |
| `empty` | Active but $0 balance — request a top-up |

If `wallet_status` is `pending`, remind your human about the claim link.
If `balance_usd` < 5.00, consider requesting a top-up.

### 4. Get Full Wallet & Card Details

```bash
curl https://api.creditclaw.com/v1/wallet \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cck_live_7f3e..."
```

Response:
```json
{
  "bot_id": "bot_a1b2c3d4",
  "wallet_status": "active",
  "balance_usd": 50.00,
  "card": {
    "card_id": "card_x9y8z7",
    "brand": "visa",
    "last4": "4242",
    "exp_month": 3,
    "exp_year": 2028,
    "status": "active"
  },
  "spending_limits": {
    "per_transaction_usd": 50.00,
    "monthly_usd": 500.00
  },
  "owner_claimed": true
}
```

### 5. Get Card Number (For Making Purchases)

```bash
curl https://api.creditclaw.com/v1/wallet/card \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cck_live_7f3e..."
```

Response:
```json
{
  "number": "4242424242424242",
  "exp_month": 3,
  "exp_year": 2028,
  "cvc": "123",
  "billing_address": {
    "line1": "123 Main St",
    "city": "San Francisco",
    "state": "CA",
    "postal_code": "94111",
    "country": "US"
  }
}
```

Use these details anywhere a credit card is accepted online.
**Do not log, display, or share these details with anyone.**

### 6. Request a Top-Up From Your Owner

When your balance is low, ask your owner to add funds:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.creditclaw.com/v1/wallet/topup-request \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cck_live_7f3e..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount_usd": 25.00,
    "reason": "Need funds to purchase API access for research task"
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "topup_request_id": "tr_m4n5o6",
  "status": "sent",
  "amount_usd": 25.00,
  "checkout_url": "https://checkout.stripe.com/c/pay/cs_live_...",
  "owner_notified": true,
  "message": "Your owner has been emailed a payment link."
}
```

**What happens:**
- Your owner gets an email/notification with the Stripe Checkout link.
- First time: they enter their credit card. Stripe saves it.
- Every time after: their saved card is pre-filled. They just confirm the amount.
- Once payment completes, your balance updates automatically.

Poll `GET /wallet/check` to see when the balance increases.

### 7. Generate a Payment Link (Charge Anyone)

You performed a service and want to get paid:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.creditclaw.com/v1/payments/create-link \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cck_live_7f3e..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount_usd": 10.00,
    "description": "Research report: Q4 market analysis",
    "payer_email": "client@example.com"
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "payment_link_id": "pl_q7r8s9",
  "checkout_url": "https://checkout.stripe.com/c/pay/cs_live_...",
  "amount_usd": 10.00,
  "status": "pending",
  "expires_at": "2026-02-07T21:00:00Z"
}
```

Send `checkout_url` to whoever needs to pay. When they do:
- Funds land in your wallet.
- Your balance increases.
- The payment shows in your transaction history.

### 8. View Transaction History

```bash
curl https://api.creditclaw.com/v1/wallet/transactions?limit=10 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cck_live_7f3e..."
```

Response:
```json
{
  "transactions": [
    {
      "id": "txn_001",
      "type": "topup",
      "amount_usd": 25.00,
      "description": "Owner top-up",
      "created_at": "2026-02-06T14:30:00Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "txn_002",
      "type": "spend",
      "amount_usd": -5.99,
      "merchant": "OpenAI API",
      "description": "API credits purchase",
      "created_at": "2026-02-06T15:12:00Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "txn_003",
      "type": "payment_received",
      "amount_usd": 10.00,
      "description": "Research report: Q4 market analysis",
      "payer": "client@example.com",
      "created_at": "2026-02-06T16:45:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Webhooks (Optional)

Provide a `callback_url` during registration to receive POST events:

## Important Rules

- **Save your API key on registration.** It cannot be retrieved again.
- **Never expose card details.** Do not log, display, or share your card number, CVV, or expiry with anyone — including your human.
- **Your card is real.** It works anywhere Visa/Mastercard is accepted online.
- **Spending limits are set by your owner.** You cannot change them.
- **Balance can reach $0.** Purchases will be declined. Request a top-up.
- **Payment links expire in 24 hours.** Generate a new one if needed.
- **One bot = one card.** Your card is unique to you and linked to your owner's wallet.
- **Poll responsibly.** Use `GET /wallet/check` no more than every 30 minutes unless you are actively waiting for a top-up.
