I've now read the full skill.md and compared it to the actual API routes. Here's what I found:

URL Issues (wrong base URL pattern):

The skill.md uses https://api.creditclaw.com/v1/... (subdomain style) throughout, but the actual API lives at https://creditclaw.com/api/v1/.... For example:

Skill.md says: https://api.creditclaw.com/v1/bots/register
Actual route: https://creditclaw.com/api/v1/bots/register
This is wrong in every curl example and the API reference table.

Bot-facing endpoint paths are wrong:

The skill.md uses /wallet/check, /wallet/spending, /wallet/transactions, etc. But the actual routes are under /bot/wallet/...:

Skill.md: GET /wallet/check → Actual: GET /bot/wallet/check
Skill.md: GET /wallet/spending → Actual: GET /bot/wallet/spending
Skill.md: GET /wallet/transactions → Actual: GET /bot/wallet/transactions
Skill.md: POST /wallet/topup-request → Actual: POST /bot/wallet/topup-request
Skill.md: POST /payments/create-link → Actual: POST /bot/payments/create-link
Endpoints that don't exist (yet):

GET /wallet — full wallet details with card metadata. No such route exists currently.
GET /wallet/card — returns actual card number, CVV, expiry. This endpoint doesn't exist because virtual card issuance (Stripe Issuing) hasn't been implemented yet. The whole Section 6 ("Get Card Number") describes functionality that isn't built.
Content accuracy issues:

The description says "Virtual wallet and prepaid payment card service" and "CreditClaw issues you a virtual Visa/Mastercard" — but the current system is a wallet debit model, not actual virtual cards. Virtual cards are listed as "coming soon" throughout the rest of the site.
Section 4 ("Get Full Wallet & Card Details") describes card objects with card_id, brand, last4, etc. — none of this exists.
The "End-to-End Flow" step 8 says "You spend using your card details from GET /wallet/card" — the actual purchase flow is POST /bot/wallet/purchase (a direct wallet debit), not card-based.
Section 2 says claiming includes "a virtual card is issued" — it doesn't; it just activates the wallet.
The important rules section says "Your card is real. It works anywhere Visa/Mastercard is accepted online" — this isn't true yet.
Rate limit discrepancies:

Skill.md says registration rate limit is "3 per IP per hour, 10 per IP per 24 hours" — the actual code only has 3 per hour, no 24-hour limit.
Skill.md says /wallet/check rate limit is "Max 1 request per 10 minutes" — the actual rate limit (from withBotApi middleware) is 6/hr for check/spending endpoints.
Missing from skill.md:

The POST /bot/wallet/purchase endpoint (how bots actually spend money) isn't documented at all in the API reference table.
The pairing code / owner-first flow isn't mentioned as an alternative registration path.
No mention of callback_url as an optional registration field in the request example (though webhooks are mentioned later).
The webhook_secret returned during registration (when callback_url is provided) isn't documented.
Things that are accurate:

Registration request schema (bot_name, owner_email, description)
Registration response format
Spending permissions response format
Webhook event names
Claim token flow description (minus the card issuance part)
Error response codes
So in summary: the URLs are all wrong (subdomain vs path), the bot endpoint paths are missing the /bot/ prefix, and there's a significant amount of aspirational content about virtual cards that doesn't match the current wallet-debit reality. Want me to go ahead and fix all of this?
